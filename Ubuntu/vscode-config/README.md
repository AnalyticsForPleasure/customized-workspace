For pushing to git automatically on save event,
works with this extension:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave

The file "settings.json" resides in Ubuntu: ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json



In order to see the console output, you have to be in the Output tab and select the Run On Save option in the dropdown. The extension was created before the integrated terminal existed and hasn't seen a major update in a while.
