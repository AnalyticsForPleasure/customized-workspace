# Completion scripts for  my utils
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The zsh-completion scripts should be located here:
```bash
~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-completions/src
```
make sure the path appears in your `echo $fpath`

* The autocomplete feature for the **helper** scripts appears in the file `_helper`

```bash
~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-completions/src/_helper
```

There is a list of terms in the file!


* Basic assumption: your shell is **zsh**
