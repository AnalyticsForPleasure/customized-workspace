#What is the difference between AI, ML, DL?

## **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

Is a very large research field, where machines show cognitive capabilities such as learning behaviours, proactive interaction with the environment, inference and deduction, computer vision, speech recognition, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, and many others. AI denotes any activity where machines mimic intelligent behaviorstypically shown by humans.

## **Machine Learning (ML)**
Is a subbranch of AI that focuses on teaching computers how to learn without the need to be programmed for specific tasks. In fact, the key idea behind ML is that it is possible to create algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data.

### Broad categories of ML

#### supervised learning
The machine is presented with input data and desired output, and the goal is to learn from those training examples in such a way that meaningful predictions can be made for fresh unseen data.

#### unsupervised learning
The machine is presented with input data only and the machine has to find some meaningful structure by itself with no external supervision.

#### reinforcement learning
The machine acts as an agent interacting with the
environment and learning what are the behaviours that generate rewards.


## **Deep Learning (DL)**
Is a particular subset of ML methodologies using artificial neural
networks (ANN) slightly inspired by the structure of neurons located in the human brain. Informally, the word deep refers to the presence of
many layers in the artificial neural network, but this meaning has changed over time. While 4 years ago, 10 layers were already sufficient to consider a network as deep, today it is more common to consider a network as deep when it has hundreds of layers.
