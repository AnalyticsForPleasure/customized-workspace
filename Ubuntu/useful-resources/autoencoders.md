## reconstruction loss

When training an **Autoencoder**, the objective is to reconstruct the input as best as possible. This is done by minimizing a loss function (just like in supervised learning).
This function is known as **reconstruction loss**.

Cross-entropy loss and Mean squared error are common examples.
