# Deep Reinforcement Learning

The idea behind Reinforcement Learning is that an agent (an AI) will learn from the environment by interacting with it (through trial and error) and receiving rewards (negative or positive) as feedback for performing actions.

Learning from interactions with the environment comes from our natural experiences.
