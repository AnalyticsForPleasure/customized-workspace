# Imputations


## Categorical columns

### Mode (By frequency)

mode is used for categorical data where we wish to know which is the most common category

## Numerical columns

Mean, median and mode are all measures of central tendency in statistics. In different ways they each tell us what value in a data set is typical or representative of the data set.


### Median

### Mean

### Create a seperate model just for predicting the the NaN values

All features in the rest of the columns are the X and the single column with the
NaN values is the target column.
