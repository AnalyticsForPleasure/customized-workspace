# Statistics

## Descriptive

1. Organizing and summarizing data using numbers & graphs

2. data Summary:
Bar Graphs, Histograms, Pir Charts, etc.
Shape of graph & skewness

3. Measures of Cental Tendency:
Mean, Median, & Mode (The number which appear most)

4. Measures of Variablity:
Range, variance & standard deviation


## Inferential

1. Using sample data to make an inference or draw a conclusion of the population.


2. Uses probabilty to determine how confident we can be that conclusions we make are correct.
(Confidence Intervals & Margins of Error)

For example let's say in a city the population is 100,000. Let's say we wish to make a test:
"How many people in this city like blue cars?"
How can we find an answer to this question, 
it would be unreasonable for us to ask every citizen in this city if they like blue cars, because that means you need to ask 100,000 people and that's not practical.
So instead what we could do is to take a ** small sample of the population ** let's say 100 people
and ask them. let's say we found out 20 people like blue cars. which means 20%.

We can use that to draw a conclusion about the population, such as 20% +- 2% (margin of error)


We can increase our confidence and get better picture of our population data and how do they like blue cars if we increase our sample size.
let's say now the population size is 1000.
let's say we found out 21 people like blue cars. which means 21%. such as: 21% +-1%. this value a better reflection of the population.
