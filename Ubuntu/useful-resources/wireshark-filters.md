# Wirehsark filter

## Filter by IP

```bash
ip.addr == 10.10.50.1
```

## Filter by Destination IP

```bash
ip.dest == 10.10.50.1
```

## Filter by Source IP

```bash
ip.src == 10.10.50.1
```

## Filter by IP Range

```bash
tcp.port == 25
```

## Filter out/Exclude IP address

```bash
!(ip.addr == 10.10.50.1)
```

## Filter IP subnet

```bash
ip.addr == 10.10.50.1/24
```

## Filter by port

```bash
tcp.port == 25
```

## Filter by destination port (TCP)

```bash
tcp.dstport == 23
```

## Filter by URL
```bash
http.host == “host name”
```

## Filter by ip address and port
```bash
ip.addr == 10.10.50.1 and Tcp.port == 25
```

## Filter SYN flag

```bash
tcp.flags.syn == 1
```

## Filter by broadcast 

```bash
eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

## Filter by RST flag

```bash
tcp.flags.reset == 1
```

## Filter by ARP between ip src computer and ip dst

```bash
(arp.dst.proto_ipv4 ==  10.100.102.20) && (arp.src.proto_ipv4 ==  10.100.102.14)
```

## Filter ping of death

**Ping of Death** packet is the maximum size of 65,535 Bytes,
typical ping packet is less then 100 Bytes.

```bash
ICMP > 60000
```
