# Anomaly Detection

## Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that uses a random forest algorithm (decision trees),
under the hood to detect outliers in the dataset. 

The algorithm tries to split or divide the data points such that each observation gets isolated from the others.
