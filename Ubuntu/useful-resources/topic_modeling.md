# Topic modeling

If any categories or labels can be in a document,
I am forced to look into unsupervised techniques to extract these topics, it's called: `Topic Modeling`.

* Topic models such as `LDA` and `NMF` have shown to be good starting points, I always felt it took quite some effort through hyperparameter tuning to create meaningful topics.

## Approaches
### TF-IDF
### LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

```python

```
###  BERTopic

```python

```
