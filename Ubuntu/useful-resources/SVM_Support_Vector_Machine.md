SVM is a supervised algorithm that classifies cases by finding a seperator.



## Pros and cons of SVM

### Advantages:
* Accurate in high-dimensional spaces
* Memory efficient

### Disadvantages:
* Prone to over-fitting (The algorithm is prone for over-fitting if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples).
* No probabilty estimation
* it's more proper for small datasets (SVMs are not very efficient computationally if your dataset is very big, such as when you have more than 1,000 rows).

SVM usage is good for:

1. Image recognition
2. Text category assignment
3. Detecting spam
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Gene Expression Classification
6. REgression, oulier detection and clustring

it's because of it's power in high-dimension ak data classification.
