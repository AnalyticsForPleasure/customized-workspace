# Celery

## What is Celery and why use it with Flask?

Web servers, like Flask, are not suited for long-running tasks,
such as video processing. Celery is a task queue for handling such
tasks in a convenient and **asynchronous manner**. 

Task data is stored in a supported back-end storage engine, like RabbitMQ or Redis.
