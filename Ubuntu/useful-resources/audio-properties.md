## The Fourier Transform

* An audio signal is comprised of several single-frequency sound waves.

* When taking samples of the signal over time, we only capture the resulting amplitudes. 



* The Fourier transform is a mathematical formula that allows us to decompose a signal into it’s individual frequencies and the frequency’s amplitude. 

* In other words, it converts the signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. The result is called a spectrum.
