## Topic Discovery

Is to discover topics in a collection of documents, and then automatically **classify** any individual document within the collection in terms of how "relevant" it is to each of the discovered topics.


**For example:**

* In a document collection related to pet animals, the terms dog, spaniel, beagle, golden retriever, puppy, bark, and woof would suggest a DOG_related theme.

* Terms cat, siamese, main coon, tabby, manx, meow, purr, and kitten would suggest a CAT_related theme.
