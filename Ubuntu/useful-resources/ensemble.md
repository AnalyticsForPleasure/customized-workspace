# Ensembles

They don't overfit as easily as the other mathods.
Ensemble methods are the most important and powerful machine learning tool and they don't suffer from the drawbacks of the other machine learning methods.

## Bias-variance trade-off
very similar to under fit or overfit which we encounter in the past.
## Boostrap
Allows us to estimate confidence intervals

## Bagging (Applying bootstrap to ML models)

## Random forests
They are fast and perform extremely well.

## AdaBoost
