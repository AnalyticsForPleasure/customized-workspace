# Statistical Inference

## Confidence Intervals

Frequency tables, histograms, boxplots, and standard errors are all ways to understand the potential error in a sample estimate. Confidence intervals are another.

* The bootstrap is a general tool that can be used to generate confidence intervals for
most statistics, or model parameters

* The lower the level of confidence you can tolerate, the narrower the confidence
interval will be.

The bootstrap is a general tool that can be used to generate confidence intervals for
most statistics, or model parameters. 

The **percentage associated with the confidence interval** is termed the **level of confidence**.


* Well explained in `page 67` from the book 

The probability question associated with a confidence interval starts out with the phrase “Given a sampling procedure and a population, what is the probability that...” To go in the opposite direc‐
tion, “Given a sample result, what is the probability that (something is true about the population)?” involves more complex calculations and deeper imponderables.
