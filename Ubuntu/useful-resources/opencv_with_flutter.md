# How to set opencv with flutter project??

**Step 1:** 

Download and extract the openCV sdk for android

**Step 2:** 

```bash
cp -R sdk/native/jni/include <project_root>
mkdir <project_root>/android/src/main/jniLibs
cp -R sdk/native/libs/* <project_root>/android/src/main/jniLibs
```

**Step 3:** 

Now we need to tell Gradle to build the app in the way that the C++ code we are going to write is accessible from the Dart context as a library. therefore we edit the file `<project_root>/android/build.gradle`

The most import part is within `externalNativeBuild` because it tells Gradle where the `CMakeLists` is located. This file has build instructions that link our code with OpenCV.

```bash
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    sourceSets {
        main.java.srcDirs += 'src/main/kotlin'
    }
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
    }
    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }
    externalNativeBuild {
        cmake {
            path "CMakeLists.txt"
        }
    }
    defaultConfig {
        externalNativeBuild {
            cmake {
                cppFlags '-frtti -fexceptions -std=c++11'
                arguments "-DANDROID_STL=c++_shared"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 4:** 

Now we need to create the `<project_root>/android/CMakeLists.txt` we have just referenced.

We mainly link our sources with the OpenCV library here and make it a library that can be called from our Dart code.

```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.6.0)
include_directories(../include) # important
add_library(lib_opencv SHARED IMPORTED)
set_target_properties(lib_opencv PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main/jniLibs/${ANDROID_ABI}/libopencv_java4.so)
set(EDGE_DETECTION_DIR "../ios/Classes")
set(SOURCES
    ${EDGE_DETECTION_DIR}/native_edge_detection.cpp
    ${EDGE_DETECTION_DIR}/edge_detector.cpp
)
add_library(native_edge_detection SHARED ${SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(native_edge_detection lib_opencv)
```

You might stumble across set(EDGE_DETECTION_DIR "../ios/Classes") and ask yourself why the ios directory in the cmake file for the Android targets. We need to put our C/C++ sources there because weâ€™ll be using CocoaPods (the packet manager of the iOS App ecosystem). CocoaPods can only reference source code from directories at the same level of the .podspec file or below. Looks a little bit hacky because the code base is used for both platforms but the Android build system is a little bit more tolerant in this regard and we can reference the sources within the ios folder from here.
