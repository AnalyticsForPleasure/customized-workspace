**With langchain**:

LangChain is a **framework for developing applications powered by language models**. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated **applications will not only call out to a language model via an API**, but will also:


Integration - Bring **external data**, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs

Agency - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next.
