**With langchain**:

LangChain is a **framework for developing applications powered by language models**. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated **applications will not only call out to a language model via an API**, but will also:

**Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data**

**Be agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment**
